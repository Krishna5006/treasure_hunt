# Treasure Island Game

Welcome to the Treasure Island Game! Your mission is to find the treasure containing lacs of hundred-dollar notes.

## How to Play

The game is text-based and will prompt you to make decisions at various stages of the journey. Your choices will determine whether you find the treasure or face other outcomes.

## Game Flow
1. The game starts by asking if you are ready to start the journey. Type `Y` to start or `N` to exit.
2. You will reach a crossroad where you need to choose to go 'left' or 'right'.
3. If you choose 'left', you will reach a lake. Decide whether to wait for a boat or swim to the castle.
4. If you wait for the boat, you will reach the castle safely. You then have the option to enter the castle or exit.
5. If you enter the castle, you will face three rooms named fire, animal, and treasure. Choose a door to enter:
    - `A` (Fire): You win the treasure.
    - `B` (Animal): A wild animal attacks you. Game over.
    - `C` (Treasure): You fall into a trap and get eaten by microbes. Game over.
6. If you exit the castle, you save your life but get nothing.
7. If you choose to swim at the lake, the lake beast devours you. Game over.
8. If you choose 'right' at the crossroad, you will never reach the treasure.
